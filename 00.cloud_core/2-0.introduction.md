### 클라우드 서비스 모델

1. Infrastructure as a Service, 
2. Platform as a Service, 
3. and Software as a Service. 

Before we dive into the details of each of these service models in the subsequent videos, let's get started with a quick overview of these models. 

​
 ## IaaS 
 is a set of compute networking and storage resources that have been virtualized by a vendor 
 
 so that a user can access and configure them any way they want.

 In design we have a concept of talking about users, called personas, and the persona for IaaS is a system admin, or an IT admin. 

> 사용자가 원하는 방식으로 액세스, 구성 
> user= system admin, IT admin.
​

## Software as a Service 

 Software as a Service is just software that you don't have to install on your machine and you don't have to manually update.
 
 And so the user for Software as a Service could be anyone.

 In fact, if you're watching this on YouTube right now, then you're a user of Software as a Service.
 
 It's usually charged on a subscription model rather than a one-time license fee.

> 시스템에 설치 할 필요 X, 업데이트 필요 X
> user = anyone
> 보통 구독 모델
​

## Platform as a Service. 
 PaaS takes advantage of all the virtualized resources from Iaas and then just abstracts them away, 
 so the user doesn't have to worry about managing any of those virtualized resources. 
 The user for PaaS is not a system admin, usually. 
 
 It's usually a dev.

 > user = 개발자

## At IBM we call this dev, Jane. That's the name of our persona.


ex ) 차를 빌릴 때. 

### So in this metaphor IaaS is like leasing a car. 

많은 조사가 필요. 차의 사양과 성능
차의 색, 종류, 운전하고 돈도 내기 때문에
기름값 통행료, 관리비도 부담

### With Platform as a Service in this metaphor, that's more like renting a car. 

휴가 중 렌터카를 빌림 
색이나 사양 별로 중요하지 않고 신경 안쓰지만
기름값, 통행료는 지불

​

## Software as a Service is again the easiest one. That one's more like getting a taxi or an uber. 

그냥 이용하기만 함
기름값이나 통행료 지불 할 필요도 없음

**IaaS**
``` 
 the cloud provider manages the physical resources, 
 data centers, cooling power, Network and security, 
 as well as computing resources that include servers and storage. 
 ```
    
**With PaaS,** 
```
the provider, in addition to the computing resources, also manages the platform infrastructure which includes the operating systems, development tools, databases, and business analytics. 
```
**In the SaaS model,** 
```
in addition to the infrastructure and the platform resources, the provider also hosts and manages the applications and data.
