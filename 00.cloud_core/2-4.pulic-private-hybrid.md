> The three cloud deployment models include— Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud.

1. 프라이빗 클라우드 : 클라우드 솔루션을 구입하여 회사 내에 설치, 직접 운영 통제하는 방식
2. 퍼블릭 클라우드 : 데이터는 클라우드 기업 서버에 저장, 일정 이용료를 내고 전문 시스템을 활용
3. 하이브리드 클라우드 : 개인적으로 보관할 자료와 기업에 맡길 자료를 분리한다.

### 프라이빗
>
> 장점 : 보안, 통제, 기존 it 자원 활용 가능
> 
> 단점 : 운영 비용, 데이터 보호 기능, 기술 변화에 취약

### 퍼블릭

> 장점 : 클라우드 관리 용이
> , 기술 변화에 빠른 대응, 초기 투자비용 없음
> 
> 단점 : 유동적 비용, 데이터가 외부에 존재->유출 risk
> 서비스 제공 기업 의존도

### 하이브리드

### ​In a public cloud model, 
    users get access to servers, storage, network, security, and applications 
    as services 
    delivered by cloud service providers 
    over the internet.
    pay-as-you-go models.

- users
  - Using web consoles and APIs, users can provision the resources and services they need.
  - don’t own the servers their applications run on or storage their data consumes
  -  or manage the operations of the servers, 
  -  or even determine how the platforms are maintained.
  -  pay for what we use within a certain period.
  -  scalability as easy as requesting more capacity. 
  -  does not have any control over the computing environment

- The cloud provider 
  - owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the infrastructure, renting it out to customers either for a subscription charge or usage-based fee.

​

Let’s talk about some of the characteristics of a public cloud: A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling tenants or users to share computing resources, residing outside their firewalls.

The cloud providers pool of resources, including infrastructure, platforms, and software, are NOT dedicated for use by a single tenant or organization.

​

Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis offered through a variety of subscription and

## private cloud
 may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

​

Private cloud platforms can be implemented internally or externally.

When the platform is provisioned over an organization’s internal infrastructure, it runs on-premises and is owned, managed, and operated by the organization.

플랫폼이 조직의 내부 인프라를 통해 프로비저닝되면 사내에서 운영되며 조직이 소유, 관리 및 운영한다.

​

When it is provisioned over a cloud provider’s infrastructure, it is owned, managed, and operated by the service provider.

This external private cloud offering that resides on a cloud service provider’s infrastructure

is called a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC.

클라우드 서비스 프로바이더의 인프라에 상주하는 이러한 외부 프라이빗 클라우드 오퍼링을 Virtual Private Cloud 또는 VPC라고 한다.

 

 A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an organization establish its own private and secure cloud-like computing environment in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud.

​

Using a VPC, organizations can leverage the dynamic scalability, high availability, and lower cost of ownership of a public cloud, while having the infrastructure and security tailored(맞춤의, 잘 맞도록 만든) to the organization’s unique needs.

Virtual Private Clouds are offered by most Public Cloud providers such as IBM and Amazon.

인프라 스트럭쳐, 보안을 특정 기업의 니즈에 맞게 가지면서도.

​

 A private cloud is a virtualized environment modeled to bring in the benefits of a public cloud platform without the perceived disadvantages of an open and shared public platform.

​

Users of a private cloud, such as Developers and Business Units in an organization, still get to leverage benefits such as economies of scale, granular scale, operational efficiencies, and user self-service, 규모의 경제, 세분화된 규모, 운영 효율성 및 사용자 셀프 서비스

while exercising full control over access, security, and compliances specific to their organization and business. 조직과 비즈니스에 특정한 접근, 보안 및 준수에 대한 완전한 통제권을 행사하는 동안.

​

Private clouds provide you with The ability to leverage the value of cloud computing using systems that are directly managed or under perceived control of the organization’s internal IT.

​

The ability to better utilize internal computing resources, such as the organization’s existing investments in hardware and software, thereby reducing costs.

Better scalability​ through virtualization and “cloud bursting,” i.e., leveraging public cloud instances for a period of time but returning to the private cloud when the surge is met.

Controlled access and greater security measures customized to specific organizational needs.

The ability to expand and provision things in a relatively short amount of time, providing greater agility.

​

Organizations may choose to opt for private cloud because of various reasons—because their applications provide a unique competitive advantage, there are security and regulatory concerns, or because the data is highly sensitive and subject to strict industry or governmental regulations.

​

Let’s look at some common use cases for a private cloud:

​A private cloud is an opportunity for organizations to modernize and unify their in-house and legacy applications.

Moving these applications from their dedicated hardware to the cloud also allows them to leverage the power of the compute resources and multiple services available on the cloud.

​

Using the private cloud, organizations are integrating data and application services from their existing applications with public cloud services.

This allows them to leverage their private cloud’s compute capability for the larger jobs while pulling data into an application on a private cloud to leverage public cloud services—essentially opening their data centers to work with cloud services.

​

Application portability is a key feature of cloud platforms.

Using the private cloud gives organizations the flexibility to build applications anywhere, out having to compromise security and compliance in the process.


Some of the key reasons that may prevent an organization from moving to a public cloud include security and regulatory concerns, and data sensitivity.

A private cloud offers these organizations the benefits of on-demand enterprise resources while exercising full control over critical security and compliance issues from within the environment of their dedicated cloud.

In the next video, we will look at the hybrid cloud model, its features, benefits, and some use cases.
