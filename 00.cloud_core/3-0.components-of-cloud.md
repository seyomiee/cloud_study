### Computing Resources:Cloud providers offer several compute options

3. and “Serverless” computing resources.

### Computing Resources: 

Cloud providers offer several compute options– Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and “Serverless” computing resources.
Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers or virtual machines (also called VMs for short), that are software-based computers, based on virtualization technologies.
Other servers in the racks are bare metal servers that are physical servers that aren’t
virtualized.
Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run their workloads on them.
Cloud users can also run their workloads on serverless computing resources, which are an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines.
We will talk about all three compute options in greater detail in subsequent videos.
### Storage: 
Information and data can consist of files,
code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases and can be stored in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.
Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local drives.
Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand and freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you
delete or decommission a cloud server.
However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can choose depending on factors like how important your data is, how quickly you want to be able to access it, how often you access it, and how secure you need it to be.
These additional storage options include Block storage, File storage, and Object storage.
Block and file storage modes are commonly used in traditional data centers, but “often struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud.” Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it’s both highly distributed and resilient.
We will examine Object Storage and the other storage options in more detail in later videos.
### Networking: 
Networking infrastructure in a cloud datacenter includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly for users of the Cloud, the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN) options where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically, through APIs.
This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.
When servers in the cloud are provisioned, you need to setup their public and private network interfaces.
The public network interfaces, as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public internet, whereas the private ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources and help keep them secure.
As in the physical IT world, network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and subnets either assigned automatically or configured.
In a cloud environment it is even more important to configure which network traffic and users can access your resources, which can be done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control Lists (or ACLs).
For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, most Cloud providers
provide Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs).
