    The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud.
    This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data Centers.

클라우드 데이타센터의 대부분 서버는 가상 서버, vm 생성을 위해 hypervisors를 실행. 

랙의 다른 서버는 가상화 되지 않은 물리적 서버인 **bare metal servers.**

* 베어 메탈 서버
  * Single tenant physical server
  * 물리 장비 하나에서 여러 가상 호스트가 떠있지않은, 전통의 서버 인프라
  * 서버 머신 하나에 하나의 환경이 구축되는 환경

* 랙
  * 서버 또는 네트워크 장비들을 넣어두는 철체 프레임
  * 서버 외에도 저장소나 스위치(network 장비)등이 탑재될 수 있다.
  * 데이터센터나 서버 룸과 같이 다수의 서버/네트워크 장비들을 두는 곳에서 사용
    * 서버 또는 네트워크 장비들을 구성할 때, 작은 공간을 효율적으로 사용하고 장비들을 안정적으로 보호하기 위해 사용


> Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run their workloads on them.

Cloud users는 workloads를 서버리스 컴퓨팅 환경에서 실행할 수 있음  which are an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines.

* 워크로드
  * it인프라 (os, middleware,app,data)로 구성
  * 실행될 수 있는 독립적 서비스나 코드의 집합
  * it서비스나 업무시스템을 물리/논리적 단위로 세분화한 것-hybrid it전환 적합성 검토의 최소 단위
 
 three compute options 
1. ### Storage: 

Information and data 
can consist of files,
code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases 
and can be stored in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.

Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local drives.
Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand and freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you
delete or decommission a cloud server.
However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can choose depending on factors like how important your data is, how quickly you want to be able to access it, how often you access it, and how secure you need it to be.
These additional storage options include Block storage, File storage, and Object storage.
Block and file storage modes are commonly used in traditional data centers, but “often struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud.” Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it’s both highly distributed and resilient.


2. ### Networking: 
Networking infrastructure in a cloud datacenter includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly for users of the Cloud, the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN) options where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically, through APIs.
This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.
When servers in the cloud are provisioned, you need to setup their public and private network interfaces.
The public network interfaces, as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public internet, whereas the private ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources and help keep them secure.
As in the physical IT world, network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and subnets either assigned automatically or configured.
In a cloud environment it is even more important to configure which network traffic and users can access your resources, which can be done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control Lists (or ACLs).
For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, most Cloud providers
provide Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs).
