Every organization’s transformation journey is unique, and therefore every organization’s cloud adoption strategy is also unique to them.

**Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness** are key drivers for moving to the cloud, provided it is done without creating business disruption or issues related to security, compliance, and performance.

Let’s look at some key considerations that organizations can use as a guide while working through their cloud strategy.

### The first consideration is infrastructure and workloads.

The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical.

#### On the other hand, low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant **cost savings**.

Also, a point to consider is that not all workloads may be ready for the cloud, as-is.


### The second consideration is around SaaS and development platforms.

애플리케이션 액세스에 대한 비용을 지불하는 것이
Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shelf software and subsequently investing in upgrades.

속도와 생산성
Organizations also need to consider speed and productivity—what it means for them to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, even months on traditional platforms.

And the person-hour cost efficiencies they gain from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics, and active analytics.

. 즉, 기존 플랫폼에서 몇 주, 심지어 몇 개월이 아닌 클라우드에서 'x' 시간 내에 새로운 애플리케이션을 가동하고 실행할 수 있다는 것이 어떤 의미인지도 고려해야 합니다. 또한 클라우드 대시보드, 실시간 통계 및 활성 분석을 사용하여 인시당 비용 효율성을 높일 수 있습니다.

### Lastly, organizations need to consider the impact of making a wrong decision—their risk exposure.

Is it riskier, for example, for them to invest in the hardware and software or rent by the hour?

Is it safer for them to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the code if they’re uncertain about adoption?

And is it better for them to “try” something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

#### 클라우드 도입의 이점
### Let’s look at some of the benefits of cloud adoption, categorized broadly into Flexibility, Efficiency, and Strategic Value. 

> Cloud gives us flexibility.

```
Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs, customize applications, and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection.
```
인터넷 연결을 통해 어디에서나 필요에 맞게 서비스를 확장하거나 확장할 수 있으며 애플리케이션을 사용자 정의하고 클라우드 서비스에 액세스할 수 있습니다.

- Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
- Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options.
- Users can select from a menu of pre-built tools and features to build a solution that fits their specific needs.
- And Virtual Private Clouds, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.

> Cloud also brings great efficiency.

- Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or its maintenance.
    ##### 엔터프라이즈 사용자는 기본 인프라 비용이나 유지 보수에 대한 걱정 없이 애플리케이션을 신속하게 출시할 수 있습니다.

- Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device.
  ##### 클라우드 기반 애플리케이션과 데이터는 거의 모든 인터넷에 연결된 장치에서 액세스할 수 있습니다.

- Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups.
    ##### 하드웨어 장애는 네트워크 백업으로 인한 데이터 손실로 이어지지 않습니다.

> Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment, and paying on use-basis.
##### 원격 리소스를 사용하여 서버 및 기타 장비의 비용을 절감하고 사용량에 따라 비용을 지불합니다.

Cloud services give enterprises a **competitive advantage** by **providing the most innovative technologies** available while managing the underlying infrastructure, thus enabling organizations to focus on their priorities.

### While cloud brings great opportunity, it also introduces challenges for business leaders and IT departments.

1. Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption 
2. Governance and sovereignty issues; Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
3. Lack of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate;
4. Choosing the right deployment and service models to serve specific needs
5. Partnering with the right cloud service providers Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery.
   
   ##### 비즈니스 중단을 일으키는 데이터의 손실 또는 가용성과 관련된 데이터 보안, 거버넌스 및 주권 문제, 법적, 규제 및 규정 준수 문제, 지속적으로 발전하고 있는 기술이 어떻게 통합되고 상호 운용되는지에 대한 표준화 결여, 특정 요구에 적합한 구축 및 서비스 모델 선택, 파트너링 적절한 클라우드 서비스 프로바이더와 함께, 비즈니스 연속성 및 재해 복구와 관련된 우려 사항.

Organizations can no longer think of cloud adoption as something that is to be looked at in the future.

With the right cloud adoption strategies, technologies, services, and service providers, these risks can be mitigated.(완화시키다)
